Installation
------------

It's recommended to use Sprinter's standalone installer:

OSX::

    cd /tmp/; rm sprinter; curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toumorokoshi/sprinter/master/scripts/sandbox.sh > /tmp/sprinter; bash /tmp/sprinter

Debian-Based (e.g. Ubuntu)::

    cd /tmp/; rm sandbox.sh; wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/toumorokoshi/sprinter/master/scripts/sandbox.sh -O sandbox.sh; bash sandbox.sh


What is it?
-----------

A cross-platform environment bootstrapping framework!

Sprinter is a framework designed to making bootstrapping development
environments easier. There are three main components to a usable
sprinter environment:

* This python egg, to fully utilize the framework
* a sprinter.cfg file, which contains the configuration necessary to install features
* sprinter formulas, which each feature uses as it's instruction manual on how to setup, update, and remove itself

Read more about Sprinter on the `docs <http://sprinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_

Command list
------------

Install an environment::

  sprinter install ENVIRONMENT.cfg
  sprinter install http://myenvironment.cfg

Install the environment specified in the environment.cfg file. It will update an environment if it already exists.::

    sprinter update MY_ENVIRONMENT

Activate MY_ENVIRONMENT::

    sprinter activate MY_ENVIRONMENT

deactivate MY_ENVIRONMENT::

    sprinter deactivate MY_ENVIRONMENT

remove MY_ENVIRONMENT::

    sprinter remove MY_ENVIRONMENT


Installing with brewed Python (OS X)
---------------------------
Brewed python (installed via `brew install python`), by default sets a prefix value in ~/.pydistutils.cfg. If this value is set, due to a bug in Python's setup tools, the Sprinter install will fail. To get around this issue do the following.

Remove all traces of brewed python::

    brew uninstall python
    brew uninstall pyenv-virtualenv

Manually move all virtualenv* files under /usr/local/bin to another folder::

    sudo mkdir /usr/local/bin/venv-old
    sudo mv /usr/local/bin/virtualenv* /usr/local/bin/venv-old/

Open a new terminal tab and double-check that you're in a clean state::

    which python # => /usr/bin/python
    which virtualenv # => virtualenv not found

Install Python and virtualenv(wrapper)::

    brew install python --with-brewed-openssl
    # Open a new terminal tab now (to access /usr/local/bin/python)
    pip install virtualenv
    pip install virtualenvwrapper
